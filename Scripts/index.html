<p>ROBLOX added a feature called <strong>Cross Play</strong> which meant that you can play ROBLOX with your friends on VR,Xbox, PC or Mac, any Mobile devices, at the same time! When this happens, this is known as using a <strong>Third Party Server.</strong>

In ROBLOX, you can socialize and talk to other people, customize your own character, and even send friend requests to people you like!
