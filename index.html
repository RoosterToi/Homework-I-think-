<p>ROBLOX, is my favorite game, with many different platforms to play on, like Xbox, Computer, Mac, and even iPhone and iPod touch!

<p>ROBLOX added a feature called <strong>Cross Play</strong> which meant that you can play ROBLOX with your friends on VR,Xbox, PC or Mac, any Mobile devices, at the same time! When this happens, this is known as using a <strong>Third Party Server.</strong>
